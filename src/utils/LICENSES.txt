This version of the code is maintained by Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de>.
My changes to the code may freely be used, modified and/or redistributed for

the version available at <http://www.jhweiss.de/software/snprintf.html>.
However, this is not a requirement for using or redistributing (possibly
modified) versions of this file, nor is leaving this notice intact mandatory.
